You may ask why DID I create a project so simple that even C or C++'s novice could do it
Well,it has three reasons.
First,I am a novice my self
Second,I will update my project as my technique's grow,now it support fstream
Third,I want to find someone awsome to offer a proposal for me,and if you find any inappropriacies or bugs in my code, you can help me improve them as well.
