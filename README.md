# Why I made this program
<br>You may ask why DID I create a project so simple that even C or C++'s novice could do it</br>
<br>Well,it has three reasons.</br>
<br>First,I am a novice my self</br>
<br>Second,I will update my project as my technique's grow,now it support fstream</br>
<br>Third,I want to find someone awsome to offer a proposal for me,and if you find any inappropriacies or bugs in my code, you can help me improve them as well.</br>
